# Weapon Holster
This resource is for people that use the [Overextended Inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory) and want a more realistic mechanic for holstering weapons.

It doesn't work for all weapons, but for those that work you can set if you want them attached to the characters Chest[^1] or Back (check `client.lua`).

It also doesn't cancel the original inventory animation for storing and retrieving weapons. (Maybe sometime in the future?)

Note: In reality you don't run around like GTA carrying multiple heavy weapons so only use this if you made adjustments for players to only carry one heavy weapon or if you don't care what type of weapon object gets attached. (If you carry more than one heavy weapon it will attach the one found first according to their names, in a ascending order.)

[^1]: Weapon Attached to the Chest.
